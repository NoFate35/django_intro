# About project
In this course, I learned the basics of using Django to develop web applications in Python. I learned how to create and configure Django projects, work with routes, templates, views, models, and forms. I also learned about the administration mechanism, template inheritance, and the basics of CRUD operations.
### Topics to be considered:
* Resource (REST-like) routing. Creating CRUD, data validation
* Django template engine. Layouts
* Managing the application from the command line
* Integration testing, factories
* ORM. Creating entities. Relationships
### Description
The project is managed by the poetry project manager and consists of several applications: 
* articles - full CRUD in Django
* comments - added a comment system
* products - implemented product filtering.
#### Testing has been conducted
